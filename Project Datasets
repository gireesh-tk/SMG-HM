# Project Datasets

This repository uses multiple datasets generated during the development of the **Segmentation Mask Guided Hybrid CNN–Vision Transformer Framework for Diagnosing Communicable Lung Diseases**. Due to storage limitations, the datasets are hosted externally on Google Drive.

## Dataset Categories

### 1. Segmented Chest X-ray Image Dataset
- Lung-region–only chest X-ray images
- Generated using a U-Net–based lung segmentation model
- Removes irrelevant background regions to focus on clinically significant areas

### 2. Pre-processed (Image-Enhanced) Dataset
- Images processed using image enhancement techniques
- Includes normalization and contrast enhancement to improve feature visibility
- Used as input to the hybrid CNN–Vision Transformer model

### 3. Augmented Image Dataset
- Generated from the pre-processed dataset using data augmentation techniques
- Includes geometric and intensity-based transformations
- Improves model generalization and class balance

### 4. Predicted Mask Dataset
- Binary lung masks predicted by the segmentation network
- Corresponds to original chest X-ray images
- Used for mask-guided feature extraction and analysis

## Dataset Access

All datasets are hosted externally due to size constraints.
